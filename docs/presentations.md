# Presentations

## End-to-end React with .NET

I present a collection of short stories involving full stack development with
React and .NET. _This exists as a work in progress._

I cover the C4 Model, formatting and git hooks, ESLint and StyleCop, Open API
and code generation, Tanstack Query, Vite and build analysis, React router,
Storybook, GitHub Copilot, and Reveal.js.

## Daily Code Reviews

I advocate for daily code reviews (CRs, a.k.a. Pull Requests, PRs) and introduce
tools to reach consistent, daily delivery.

I describe the benefits of small commits and fast reviews, share best practices
for splitting commits, and recommend guidelines for code review size.

## TDD: Yes You Can!

I discuss Test Driven Development (TDD) with a focus on making it your own and
not restricting yourself to the strictness often associated with TDD.

I cover definitions, give my recipes for success, and walk through code examples.
